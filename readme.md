# Cyotek.Windows.Forms.ImageBox

The `ImageBox` is a custom control for displaying images. It supports zooming, scrolling, panning, region selection and much more! In addition to the traditional mode of binding to an Image, you can also use a virtual mode, and providing your own drawing whilst retaining all the `ImageBox` functionality.
